#SORTING
'''
    In cases where rows have the same value (this is common if you sort on a categorical variable), you may wish to break the ties by sorting on another column. You can sort on multiple columns in this way by passing a list of column names.
        
        Sort on â€¦	        Syntax
        one column	        df.sort_values("breed")
        multiple columns	df.sort_values(["breed", "weight_kg"])

homelessness_reg = homelessness.sort_values('region')
homelessness_state = homelessness.sort_values('state')
homelessness_ind = homelessness.sort_values('individuals')
homelessness_fm = homelessness.sort_values('family_members', ascending=False)

#SUBSETTING
'''
    When working with data, you may not need all of the variables in your dataset. Square brackets ([]) can be used to select only the columns that matter to you in an order that makes sense to you 
'''
regions = homelessness['region']
state = homelessness['state']
individuals = homelessness['individuals']
family_members = homelessness['family_members']
state_populations = homelessness['state_pop']
regions_and_state = homelessness[['region', 'state']]

#SUBSETTING ROWS
'''
    One of the simplest techniques for this is to find a subset of rows that match some criteria. This is sometimes known as filtering rows or selecting rows.
    There are many ways to subset a DataFrame, perhaps the most common is to use relational operators to return True or False for each row, then pass that inside square brackets.
            dogs[dogs["height_cm"] > 60]
            dogs[dogs["color"] == "tan"]
